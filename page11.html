        <u>Our Mission: </u> <br>
        <br>
            Community Connect exists to bring people together. The creators realized that, 
            despite a variety of volunteer opportunities being available at any given time, 
            very few people actually volunteer. It was theorized that few people volunteer as a result of 
            volunteer opportunities being difficult to find, and therefore, if it were easier to find opportunities, 
            more people would volunteer. In an effort to increase volunteering and community engagement as a whole, 
            Community Connect was created.
